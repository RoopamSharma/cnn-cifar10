The project is based on the implementation of the Convolutional Neural Network for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The input data consists of 10 set of images where each set represents the image class.
The network builds a model that helps in determining the probability of new image belonging to each of the class.

Download the cifar-10 dataset, extract it and place its content in folder named Data.
